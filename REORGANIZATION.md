# Excel MCP Server Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Excel MCP Server directory structure to improve organization and maintainability.

## Directory Structure Changes

The Excel MCP Server directory structure has been reorganized as follows:

```
excel-mcp-server/
  Dockerfile                 # Main Docker configuration
  LICENSE                    # Project license
  pyproject.toml            # Python package configuration
  README.md                 # Main documentation
  uv.lock                   # Dependency lock file
  build/                    # Build and deployment scripts
    build.ps1
    build.sh
    deploy.ps1
    deploy.sh
    docker-entrypoint.sh    # Moved from root
    lint.ps1
    lint.sh
    test.ps1
    test.sh
  docs/                     # Better organized documentation
    README.md               # Documentation index
    USING_WITH_AI.md        # AI integration guide
    UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
    IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
    CSV_UPDATE_README.md
    api/                    # API documentation
      API.md
      TOOLS.md
    deployment/             # Deployment documentation
      BUILD_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md
      HEALTH_CHECKS.md
    features/               # Feature documentation
      CSV_OPERATIONS.md
      FILE_OPERATIONS.md
  excel_files/              # Excel file storage
  health/                   # Health check files
    health.js
    health.py
  src/                      # Source code
  tests/                    # Test files
```

## File Moves

The following files were moved:

1. From root to `build/`:
   - `docker-entrypoint.sh`
   - `build.ps1`, `build.sh`
   - `deploy.ps1`, `deploy.sh`
   - `lint.ps1`, `lint.sh`
   - `test.ps1`, `test.sh`

2. From root to `health/`:
   - `health.py`
   - `health.js`

3. Documentation reorganization:
   - API documentation moved to `docs/api/`
   - Deployment documentation moved to `docs/deployment/`
   - Feature documentation moved to `docs/features/`

## Documentation Updates

All documentation references have been updated to reflect the new directory structure:

1. In README.md:
   - Updated script paths to reference the `build/` directory
   - Updated documentation links to reference new locations in the `docs/` directories
   - Added reference to the documentation index

2. Added a documentation index at `docs/README.md` that provides an overview of all available documentation.

## Docker Configuration Updates

The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have been updated to reference the new file locations:

1. In Dockerfile:
   - Updated paths for `health.py` to `health/health.py`
   - Updated paths for build scripts to the `build/` directory

2. In docker-compose.yml:
   - Updated volume mount for `health.py` to use the new path

## Next Steps

The reorganization has improved the structure of the codebase, making it more maintainable and easier to navigate. This reorganization follows standard project organization practices:

- Configuration files at the root level
- Source code in the `src/` directory
- Documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Build and deployment scripts in the `build/` directory
- Health check files in the `health/` directory
- Test files in the `tests/` directory

This structure will make it easier to:
1. Understand the codebase
2. Find specific files
3. Maintain the project going forward
4. Scale with additional features

For any questions or concerns about the reorganization, please refer to the documentation or contact the project maintainers.
